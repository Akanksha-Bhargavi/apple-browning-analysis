# **Factors Influencing Browning in Apple Slices: Experimental Analysis**

## **Project Description**
- This project aims to explore the factors that influence the browning of apple slices, particularly in the context of storing them in brown bag lunches. The browning process, caused by enzymatic reactions when the fruitâ€™s flesh is exposed to air, affects the aesthetic and nutritional qualities of apples. The study investigates various pretreatment solutions and storage methods to minimize browning before lunchtime.

## **Objectives**
- The primary objectives of this study are:
- To identify effective pretreatment solutions for reducing browning in apple slices.
- To evaluate the effect of different storage containers on the freshness and appearance of apple slices.
- To explore the interaction between pretreatment solutions and storage containers on the extent of browning.
  
## **Scope of Project**
- This project covers:Experimental analysis of four apple varieties (Fuji, Braeburn, Red Delicious, and Granny Smith).
- 12 treatment combinations involving different pretreatment solutions and storage containers.
- The assessment of enzymatic browning as a response variable.
- Various statistical analyses including Linear Regression, Randomized Complete Block Design (RCB), and a partially confounded model.
  
## **Dataset Information**
- The dataset consists of experimental observations on the extent of browning exhibited by apple slices under different treatment conditions. It includes:
- Block: Apple varieties (Fuji, Braeburn, Red Delicious, Granny Smith).
- Factor A: Pretreatment solutions (none, lemon juice, baking soda water, saltwater solution, etc.).
- Factor B: Storage containers (open air, Ziploc bag, Tupperware).
- Rating: Enzymatic browning rating of apple slices, scored from 1 to 10.

## **Results & Findings**
- Linear Regression: Significant effects were found for certain pretreatment solutions, but storage container choice did not significantly affect the browning.
- RCB: Pretreatment solutions significantly influenced browning ratings, while storage containers and blocks showed negligible effects.
- Partially Confounded Model: After simulation, temperature emerged as a key factor in determining the degree of browning, with lower temperatures showing less browning.

## **Conclusion**
- The analysis demonstrates that pretreatment solutions, particularly lemon juice and saltwater solution, play a significant role in reducing browning. Storage container choice and the interaction between treatment factors were found to be less influential. The study suggests that temperature management may also play a critical role in minimizing browning.
